Rancher vs Openshift

My pick out of these two is rancher, reasoning is:

- Even though redhat claims you're not locked in to a service provider, using Openshift means you must run it on red hat linux. Rancher is way more flexible.
- Installation/updates of Rancher is trivial where as Openshift requires a lot more work
- Rancher is standards based and open source, openshift relies more on their own tools and practises, enterprise version is not open source
- Operating cost are lower with rancher, due to openshift being heavyweight solution. Of course one might need all additional featuress
- As rancher is more popular, community support is better. Both platforms have enterprise support available for a similar fee.
- This is a slightly apples/oranges comparison, but to me pick is easy.
